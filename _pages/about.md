I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Nottingham working with Adam Gammon-Smith. 

Research Interests
======

My general research interests consist of a variety of topics in theoretical condensed matter physics including

 - Non-equilibrium quantum transport
 - Mesoscopic systems
 - Many-body localisation
 - Topological superconductivity

I utilise both analytical and numerical techniques to tackle problems in these areas Further details can be found on
