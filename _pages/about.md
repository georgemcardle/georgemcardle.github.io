I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Nottingham working with Adam Gammon-Smith, having previously done my PhD and a postdoctoral position at the University of Birmingham with Igor Lerner. 

My general research interests consist of a variety of topics in theoretical condensed matter physics including:

 - Non-equilibrium quantum transport
 - Mesoscopic systems
 - Many-body localisation
 - Topological superconductivity

During my PhD I was particularly interested in applying Keldysh field theory to explore the absence of thermalisation in mesoscopic systems and how signatures of this can arise in the transport of the system. This work was done in close conjuction with experimentalists, something I have continued in my current research where I am interested in topological superconductivity and the relation to quantum computing. In particular I am interested in experimental systems that have the potential to host Majorana modes, which have a possible application as a topological qubit. Further details of my research interests can be found on the [research page](/research/) or on [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UwStDnYAAAAJ&hl=en).
