## Transport in Quantum Dots
------
Quantum dots are effectively zero-dimensional systems and are characterised by the presence of the Coulomb interaction. For a dot containing a large number of electrons this leads to the regime of the classical Coulomb Blockade where a charging energy must be overcome in order to add more electrons onto the dot. Therefore, it is not surprising that the charge transport is influenced by this leading to Coulomb blockade peaks in linear response and the Coulomb staircase in the non-equilibrium regime.

These well-established results assume that the electrons on the dot are fully thermalised, and therefore are described by a Fermi-Dirac distribution.
